"""Export and restore the hub's configuration as one file.

Everything AdGuardHub knows lives in a single SQLite file. Lose it — a wiped
volume, a mistyped ``docker run -v`` — and the rules, subscriptions, instance
settings and the whole version history go with it, leaving a re-import from
whichever node happens to still have them as the only way back. This turns that
into a file the operator holds.

The document is deliberately the same snapshot the version history already
records, so export, rollback and restore all move the same shape of data and
there is only one thing to keep correct.

Three rules govern what goes in and how it comes back:

* **No secrets, ever.** An export is downloaded through a browser, and an
  instance password must never be serialised there — not in the clear and not as
  ciphertext, which would only be one leaked ADGUARDHUB_SECRET_KEY away from the
  same thing. Instances are exported without their password, and come back
  needing it typed again.
* **Validate before destroying.** Restoring replaces the rule and subscription
  tables wholesale. A malformed file must be rejected while the hub still has
  its data, not halfway through replacing it.
* **Never overwrite an instance that already works.** A restore onto a running
  hub adds what is missing and leaves the rest alone, so it cannot strip the
  credentials off a node that was connected fine a moment ago.
